# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.



Just a small Frontend on the project-express-api.
In order to practice the endpoints.
Not responsive, yet.
Needs some more love.
